# Zoom Detector

A .NET application to send messages to an MQTT broker when a Zoom meeting starts
and stops on your local machine.  
I use this with my other project,
[pi-ticker](https://github.com/mapitman/pi-ticker), to display messages on a 
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with
a [Unicorn HAT HD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat-hd).
